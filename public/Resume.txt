PROJECTS:

	Name: PortPal: AI-Powered Chatbot for Portfolio Interactions
	Description: Developed a conversational AI chatbot using Azure OpenAI and GPT to facilitate real-time, context-aware user interactions. System instructions were configured to personalize the chatbot’s responses based on the user’s resume, enhancing engagement and ensuring tailored conversations. The chatbot was seamlessly integrated into the website, significantly improving the user experience and enabling easy navigation of the portfolio. Additionally, dynamic message handling was implemented with state management, allowing for real-time updates and smooth interaction, while automatic scrolling ensured users could follow the conversation effortlessly.

	Name: Servo-Controlled Obstacle Detection Radar
    Description: The Servo-Controlled Obstacle Detection Radar is a real-time obstacle detection system that combines an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor to scan a 180° environment. Controlled by an Arduino MKR Vidor 4000, the system measures distances to nearby objects and provides real-time feedback through an LCD display, LED indicator, and buzzer. Additionally, a Processing-based graphical interface visualizes the radar sweep, displaying detected objects in different colors based on their proximity. The project integrates hardware components such as a breadboard, jumper wires, resistors, and an I2C-based LCD, and operates via Arduino and Processing code. The system alerts users when obstacles are within a critical range, making it a cost-effective and scalable solution for obstacle detection applications.

	Name: Authenticator
    Description: The Authenticator project is a secure and user-friendly authentication system built using the Django framework, providing seamless login and registration functionality. It incorporates form validation, error handling, and email confirmation to enhance security and user experience. The frontend, developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, features a responsive design, smooth scrolling, a typing effect for the welcome message, and animated form inputs for a modern interface. The backend leverages Django's built-in authentication system, handling user login, logout, session management, and email verification to ensure account security. Upon registration, users receive a confirmation email before gaining access, and authenticated users can securely log out to terminate their sessions. This project prioritizes both functionality and usability, delivering a robust authentication solution.

	Name: Image Processing with Edge Detection and Seam Carving
    Description: The Image Processing with Edge Detection and Seam Carving project provides efficient tools for image analysis, focusing on Canny edge detection and seam carving for content-aware resizing. It includes custom filtering techniques and advanced algorithms to detect edges and resize images dynamically. The MyCanny function implements the Canny edge detection algorithm, incorporating Gaussian blur, Sobel filtering, non-maximum suppression, and thresholding, while MyCannyFull extends it with hysteresis thresholding for enhanced edge linking. The MySeamCarving function resizes images by removing low-energy seams, preserving essential content. The project includes Jupyter notebooks demonstrating these functions, showcasing edge detection, hysteresis thresholding, and seam carving. Acknowledging contributions from PyTorch and Kornia, this project leverages modern libraries to achieve advanced image processing tasks.

	Name: Car Sales Prediction
    Description: The Car Sales Prediction project aims to forecast future car sales using machine learning techniques by analyzing historical sales data. The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle that includes features such as date, model, manufacturer, price, and sales volume, among others. Various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, are used to build predictive models. The models are evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score, with the Random Forest model showing the best performance, achieving the lowest MAE and MSE. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning for sales prediction and highlights key model evaluation techniques. Special thanks are given to Dr. Ruba Alomari for guidance throughout the project.

	Name: The Bird Game
    Description: Your Bird Game project is a remake of the classic "Flappy Bird" using LOVE 2D and Lua. Players control the bird with the "Spacebar" to avoid pipes while the score increases with each successfully passed pipe. The game ends upon a collision with a pipe, and players can exit by pressing "ESC." This project was developed as part of the CS50x course.
